Attach the mount to a suited railing structure or similar. Adjust the height of the mount so that the sensor planes of 
ASI and GHI pyranometer and potentially further irradiance sensors on site are at the same height. Make sure to avoid
obstructions in the fields of views of ASI and pyranometer.

If possible attach a surge protector to the mounting structure using a cable tie. Attach it closely below the camera 
(cable should be short):

Connect the camera with ethernet cables to surge protector, surge protector to PoE adapter. Connect PoE adapter to 
router and electricity.

Insulate the cable inlet into the camera with an appropriate sealing.

Secure all cable runs with cable ties. It is best practice to install cables so that they are shaded throughout most of 
the day. I.e. where ever possible cables should run below or on side facing away from the equator of the structure they
are fixed on. Make sure that cables are not under tension at any point. Make sure cables are placed so that humidity is
led away from the instruments not into the instruments' cable connectors.

Double-check that camera is mounted rigidly and leveled. 

Finally, take photos, which document the instruments mounting and their leveling, cableing and the setup in the electrical cabinet.
