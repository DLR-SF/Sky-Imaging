Module Contents

.. py:function:: generate_image_series_paths(init_time, path_structure, camera_name, img_exposure_time, time_gap)

   Create a list of image file paths for the given timestamp, camera, exposure time and time gaps

   :param init_time: (datetime) Initial timestamp for the creation of the image series.
   :param path_structure: (string) formated string to build up the path to each camera image folder. It shall contain
       {camera_name}, {exposure_time} and {timestamp:...} where the camera name, exposure_time and evaluated date is
       inserted.
   :param camera_name: (string) camera name
   :param img_exposure_time: (int) exposure time of the image in milliseconds.
   :param time_gap: (int) list of seconds between each image.
   :return image_paths: (string) list of image file paths


.. py:function:: find_closest_image(missing_time, existing_paths)

   Find the image file with the closest time to the missing one from the given paths list

   :param missing_time: (datetime) timestamp of the missing image file.
   :param existing_paths: (string list) list of paths to look for.
   :return: (string) path to the image file closest in time.


.. py:function:: get_image_path(expected_path, time_tolerance)

   Get the image file path with the closest time to the expected one with certain time tolerance

   :param expected_path: (string) expected path to the image file.
   :param time_tolerance: (float)  time tolerance in seconds for searching a file path.
   :return: (string) path to the image file closest in time. If nothing found return [].


.. py:function:: get_image_series_path(init_time, path_structure, camera_name, exposure_time, time_gap=[0], time_tolerance=0)

   Get a list of paths of a series of images given a list of seconds between each image.

   :param init_time: (datetime) initial timestamp for the creation of the image series.
   :param path_structure: (string) formated string to build up the path to each camera image folder. It shall contain
       {camera_name}, {exposure_time} and {timestamp:...} where the camera name, expos is inserted, evaluated date is
       inserted and where the exposure time is inserted.
   :param camera_name: (string) camera name
   :param exposure_time: (int) exposure time of the image in milliseconds.
   :param time_gap: (int) list of seconds between each image. Default is [0]
   :param time_tolerance: (float) time tolerance in seconds for searching a file path. Default is 0
