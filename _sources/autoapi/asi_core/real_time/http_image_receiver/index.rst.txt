   .. py:method:: record_continuously()

      Once called, this function runs infinitely taking images at the defined sampling rate



   .. py:method:: trigger_store_exposure()

      Triggers, receives and saves a snapshot from the camera.

      Exposure time etc. remain unchanged. Only a snapshot is requested and saved



   .. py:method:: check_adjust_day_nighttime_settings()

      Check sun elevation and if needed change camera settings which are different during day- and nighttime.

      This is a dummy. Implemented for compatible cameras.



   .. py:method:: prepare_image_acquisition()

      Prepare image acquisition.

      Check if conditions for recording images are met. Either for standard daylight images (depending on sun
      elevation) or nighttime images when there is (almost) full moon and the moon is above the horizon.

      :return: Boolean whether image should be recorded.

       after previous request
   :param timezone_images: see ImageReceiver
   :param rel_threshold_exposure: Relative deviation of exp. time. Image will be rejected if real exp. time
       deviates stronger from expected value
   :param safety_deadtime_between_exposure_series: Cancel acquisition of exposure series if less than this time
       remains until end of sampling period
   :param nighttime_mode: Acquisition mode used during nighttime. Optimized for different purposes: Moon detection,
       cloud detection, ...

   .. py:method:: check_adjust_day_nighttime_settings(is_night)

      Adapt exposure settings between day- and nighttime. So far only for one specific setup and camera type.

      Time of day information is received via argument. Information if night- or daytime settings are actually set, 
      is read from images (in image acquisition method). If set and required settings do not match, the parameters 
      are written to the camera.

      :param is_night: Boolean, True if nighttime is present.



   .. py:method:: get_real_exposure_properties(img)

      Checks the exposure time and other parameters noted in the header of a Mobotix JPEG.

      Mobotix JPEGs possess a specific header. This is fundamental for the function.

      Exposure times of 1e4 seconds and more are not expected.

      :return: int, read exposure time in microseconds
